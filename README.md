# Ubuntu Requests - Image Fetcher

## About

It connects to the global community respectfully, handling errors gracefully, and organizing downloads for later sharing.

## Features
- Prompts user for an image URL
- Creates Fetched_Images directory if it is not there
- Downloads and saves the image with a proper filename
- Checks that the file is actually an image
- Prevents duplicate downloads
- Handles network errors gracefully
